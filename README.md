# 🏙️ LA Zoning Automation – Prototype (Beta)

**Rapid-deploy prototype for automating zoning, land-use, and planning intelligence across Los Angeles County.**

This repository contains an early-stage, modular prototype designed to streamline zoning research workflows for architects, planners, and developers. The goal is to automate parcel lookups, overlay extraction, environmental layers, and regulatory interpretation using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **LLM-based analysis**.

This **beta version** serves as a flexible foundation where new workflows, micro-apps, and automation modules can be plugged in as they are built. The final vision is to consolidate these components into a full **architectural automation platform for Los Angeles County**.

## 🚀 Current Prototype Features
- Automated retrieval of core zoning & planning data  
- Standardized JSON output for downstream tools  
- Basic Streamlit interface for address/APN input  
- LLM-assisted zoning summaries and insights  
- Modular structure for adding new planning layers  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- OpenAI / LLMs  
- Public LA zoning & planning datasets
